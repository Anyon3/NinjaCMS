EXTRA
------

The directory extra/ contain the sphinx.conf which provide all information about the SQL database structure. As SphinxSearch (http://sphinxsearch.com/) software is optimized for mySQL, I recommand to use this DBMS.

I cannot provide directly the SQL for the sake of the privacy of all members of this defunt community.
